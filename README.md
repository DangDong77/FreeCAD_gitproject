# FreeCAD git project workbench

Target of this workbench is to allow easy versioning of your FreeCAD projects.
If a FreeCAD file is inside a git repo, all changes (i.e. you pressed save)
should be automatically commited.

# Dependency

Install `python-git` ([GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython)).


# Features

This workbench should have the following features:

* automatically create a new commit when the file is saved
* create a new git repo at the current folder of the file
* create tags `// TODO`
* turn autocommit on and off `// TODO`
* create own commits with messages `// TODO`
* show that this file is under version control `// TODO`
* ???
* Maybe merge in [WebTools](https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/WebTools) `// TODO`
